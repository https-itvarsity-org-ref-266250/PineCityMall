		<p><strong>WHO ARE WE ?</strong></p>
	
		<p>From gaming consoles and mobile phones to kitchen fridges and toasters, there certainly is something for everyone when it comes to to modern electronics and home appliances.And the fact that more and more shops in S.A are branching  out to include almost anything that's pluggable or chargeable means ever-increasing options for all shoppers.</p>
		
			 <p>The other great thing about more suppliers offering electronic gadget ?How it affects prices, evidenced by the gap in costs between your casual budget-frienbdly stores like Mr Price Home and Makro, and more high-style options like Yuppiechef and Apple. That means, whether search of a new laptop, a smartphone or am ice cream maker, you're sure to find the ideal store and price(and brand)for your lifestyle.</p>
